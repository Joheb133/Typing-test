# Typing-test

### Description
A website that tests the users typing skills by swarming them with enemies that can only be killed using their keyword.

### Technicalities
This website is built using *TypeScript* and *ThreeJS*

### Difficulties
I had to learn about how 3d enviroments work. I learned about different types of textures like emission maps and normal maps, what UV maps were and how 3d enviroments work in threejs and other 3d software like Blender.
